We know it's hard to plan a good diet when you are on the run. When all you have time for is a quick stop at the nearest fast food restaurant, MenuMetrics uses your GPS to pull up the menu of whatever restaurant you are at! Just open up the app and choose from menu options sorted by any nutrition parameter you wish, be it sodium, fat, or sugar!

Metrics of Success:

*Percentage of people who signed up with their emails (divided by) number of people solicited

*Percentage of people who recommend our app to their associates
